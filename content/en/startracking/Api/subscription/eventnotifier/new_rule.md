    Everything starts by creating a Rule:
---

> Lets set some examples:

## Channel Type: EMAIL

### Example #1
As a Freight Forwarder, I want to notify **- VIA EMAIL -** my local office when the shipment is ready for pick up at the destination.
To do that, we create a new rule. Then, we can decide to apply the rule for all the available Carriers or a specific one; we could type a full AWB number if we want to monitor only a single shipment.
We indicate the JFK airport as arrival, "Event" as "alert type", and "ARR" as milestone event. Finally, we can type our JFK office email address and choose the email format between plain text or HTML, ad save.

### Example #2
As a Freight Forwarder, I want to receive a notification the moment the event does not occur.
For example, we can receive a notification if we forget to transmit our FWB msgs to the Carrier. Receiving this email will prevent future carriers charges.
To do that, we will set a rule to receive a Missed Event notification for each shipment missing FWB message.

### Example #3
As a Freight Forwarder, I want to be notified only when a real problem occurs. 
In this example, using the Proactive Milestone, Star Tracking will notify the user that the departure message did not occur within a user custom defined interval (e.g. 240 minutes).

## Channel Type: URL

As a Freight Forwarder I want to be notified for all my shipments, only the actual events of type DEP, ARR, NFD and DLV

The response is 200 OK: 

```json
{
    "ChannelType": "Url",
    "NotifyTo": "342DE97C-C63C-475D-A4A8-7B52F43D154E",
    "HeaderItems": "",
