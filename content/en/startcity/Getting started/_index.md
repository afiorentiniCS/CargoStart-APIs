The interaction with the **Malpensa Smart City** can happen in two ways:

-   Using the log-in area of the website, entering the necessary data on a specific screen manually;
-   Using a system for the routing of electronic flows.

**[CargoStart Start City](https://www.cargostart.net/solution/start-city/)** service allows an automatic dialogue: the freight forwarder will send us the FWB and FHL messages for the shipments departing from the airport of Milan MXP, with some additional information.

**[CargoStart Start City](https://www.cargostart.net/solution/start-city/)** formats the messages and sends it to the Ecosystem Cargo MXP.

Thanks to our partnership with software houses specialised in the airfreight industry, the service can be directly integrated in the management systems in use.
